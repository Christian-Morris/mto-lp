        <p>Results day was pure joy, seeing the smile on your child's face as they open that envelope and know that they will be able to go where they want, to study the subjects they hoped to, and most importantly they're staying with their friends... <br>This memory will always stay with you. <br>Although, you're most grateful for seeing the fear and pain go from their eyes when anything related to school is mentioned. Homework stopped being a struggle, lessons at school started making sense, grades across all subjects started going up, and they had more time for fun with the family (and that time was a lot more enjoyable!). That is what you're truly grateful for. </p>

        <h4>Marcus Rowley</h4>
        <iframe class="video mobile-only" src="https://youtube.com/embed/My7pGKDGXPU"></iframe>
        <p>Marcus noticed his grades dropping since the change of his Maths teacher last year. After he started year 11 with the same teacher, he knew he needed help to reach his full potential. During his first 6 week program with us Marcus took his grade 6/7 all the way back up to a 9, scoring 100% in our final test. We even found that there were commonly asked questions, such as Histograms, which he hadn't covered in school!</p>

        <h4>Alfie Eichhorn</h4>
        <iframe class="video mobile-only" src="https://youtube.com/embed/AHdyx2lXZ7M"></iframe>
        <p>Alfie was your classic student who was not achieving the marks he could. He previously hasn't had the support to realise his potential and didn't know there was an alternative to school and the Maths he has experienced in the past. So it was no surprise that Alfie was aprehensive when his mum mentioned the idea of tutoring. After talking to us, he decided to give it a shot and since his attitude towards Maths has completely turned around from dreading the idea to looking forward to the sessions each week. The change in his confidence, understanding, and general attitude towards Maths been drastically reinforced considering he came to us at a grade 3/4 and after 6 weeks, bumped that up to a grade 6! </p>

Some need very little explanation, others need a lot. Some need a lot of practice, other's don't. Some need to be held accountable to doing the work, others will to do it on their own. There is no one single path to achieve success, but there is one solution that fits all! That's us!</p>
