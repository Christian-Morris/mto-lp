        <iframe class="video mobile-only" src="https://youtube.com/embed/My7pGKDGXPU"></iframe>
        <p>Marcus noticed his grades dropping since the change of his Maths teacher last year. After he started year 11 with the same teacher, he knew he needed help to reach his full potential. During his first 6 week program with us Marcus took his grade 6/7 all the way back up to a 9, scoring 100% in our final test. We even found that there were commonly asked questions, such as Histograms, which he hadn't covered in school! <br><strong>"Beneficial!", "Do it!" - Marcus</strong></p>

        <p>Alfie was your classic student who was not achieving the marks he could. He hasn't had the support needed to realise his potential and didn't know there was an alternative to typical school Maths. Alfie was aprehensive when his mum mentioned the idea of tutoring but after talking to us, he decided to give it a shot! Since, his attitude towards Maths has completely turned around, from dreading the idea to looking forward to the sessions each week. The change in his confidence, understanding, and general attitude towards Maths been increased further as he came to us at a grade 3/4 and after 6 weeks, bumped that up to a grade 6! <br><strong>"Honestly, go for it!", "It's the same Maths... just better!" - Alfie</strong></p>

        <p>Tshepi is walking proof that anyone can do it. People aren't born either naturally "Mathsy" or not. Like so many others, she was labelled by her school as a "special" case and that she would never make it. She had the desire to improve and came to us with a momentum of positivity & effort, which we then took and pushed it even further. Starting with us at a grade 7 and reaching a grade 9 only 6 weeks later. <br><strong>"You will definitely want to do more!", "I would do this for all of next year!" - Tshepi</strong></p>

Some need very little explanation, others need a lot. Some need a lot of practice, other's don't. Some need to be held accountable to doing the work, others will to do it on their own. There is no one single path to achieve success, but there is one solution that fits all! That's us!</p>

          <p><strong>BSc Mathematics - University of Leeds</strong><br>Maths didn't come easily to Gabriella, it was actually one of her weakest subjects at school, as so many students can relate. Prior to starting her Mathematics degree at Leeds, she had to take a foundation year to be up to standard to start her degree. Through sheer perseverance and grit, she has become exactly what she always wanted... <em>the</em> Maths teacher that believes in her students, to help others realise that they can learn anything too. It helps her empathise with students because she remembers how lost and hopeless she felt in their shoes. <br><br><strong>Personality, Hobbies & Interests:</strong><br>Gabriella finds passion in the arts and living life to its fullest. <br>Her main hobby categories are:<br>1 - Reading <br>2 - Music<br>3 - Travelling<br>Gabriella loves exploring all types of genres and perspectives. She is an avid drummer and has even written and recorded some of her own music! Gabriella strives to live life as if it were an endless summer, to experience all the world has to offer in terms of culture, cuisines and activities. Asian cuisine is a particular favourite and even once fueled her on a 5km swim to explore a deserted island in Cambodia!</p>

When it comes to Bollywood; movies and Punjabi music are a core staple of Kevin's personality (all recommendations are welcomed!).

That's not where his interest in music stops though as Joe has also taken up DJing over the past 6 years which allows the variety in his taste of music to show through to a wider audience.</p>

          <p><strong>BSc Physics & Astrophysics - University of York</strong><br>Having worked over a decade in the mainstream schooling system, Rich has a depth of relatability to his students that is hard to come by. Not to mention his vast experience with SEN students. Similarly to most students, his favourite aspect of Maths and Physics are the tangible bits that can be used in the real world to predict what will happen or make something!<br><br><strong>Personality, Hobbies & Interests:</strong><br>Rich's main hobby unfortunately takes him away from his loyal doggo and mischievous cat. Let's just say that he likes to see the bigger picture... to get some perspective on the world...  <br>His two main hobby categories are:<br>1 - Sky Diving<br>2 - Flying<br>Just like most cats, Rich does his best thinking from a high vantage point. He carried out some rather interesting research into which shape of tea bags makes the best cuppa. It might be boring to some, but when the eureka moment comes whilst plummeting 180mph to the earth's surface, it makes the mundane a little more exciting! </p>
